Detailed information on dis - parities in COVID-19 cases and deaths among Marshallese persons has been reported (2, 8); however, less information has been available regarding other Pacific Islander or Asian sub - groups. These findings demonstrate the value of having access to disaggregated data at the state level to identify and reduce disparities and to provide relevant data to communities (4, 5, 7) . Collection of disaggregated surveillance data was recom - mended by local Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander com - munities and grassroots groups early in the pandemic, resulting in the updating of the COVID-19 case report form by HDOH to collect these data. Patients with COVID-19 whose cases were reported before revision of the case report form were retrospec - tively contacted by HDOH staff members for detailed race information. **** During periods of higher incidence, HDOH continued to prioritize obtaining important demographic information, including race, even when conducting abbrevi - ated case\",\n                \"During March 1, 2020February 28, 2021, in Hawaii the COVID-19 incidence was 1, 477 per 100, 000 population and mortality rate was 32 per 100, 000 population (Table) . In aggregated analyses of incidence, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander persons experienced the highest incidences (2, 501) across the five minimum race categories. In disaggregated analyses, Pacific Islander persons, who account for 5% of Hawaiis population, represented 22% of cases. Pacific Islander persons had the highest COVID-19 incidence of 7, 070; incidence among Native Hawaiian persons was 1, 181. After further disaggregation, the highest incidence of cases among all Pacific Islander subcategories occurred among Marshallese persons (10, 580), followed by Other Micronesian persons (8, 991) and Samoan persons (4, 525) (Figure) .\",\n                \"In disaggregated analyses of crude mortality, Pacific Islander persons experienced a crude mortality rate of 150 deaths per 100, 000 population and accounted for 22% of deaths during this period.

The highest incidence of cases among Asian persons were among Filipino persons (1, 247) and Vietnamese persons (1, 200); incidence among Japanese persons was 568.

Efforts were designed to achieve a balance between highlighting the concerns of specific populations and inadvertently contributing to the stigmatization of groups who have been marginalized and who experience racism. Race can serve as a marker for underlying systemic and structural inequities that drive health disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need to prevent and reduce inequities in the social determinants of health, access to health care, and health conditions (8, 9). There are simultaneous needs for advancing cultural responsiveness, language access, and sensitivity in public health strategies for preventing COVID-19 among Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian subgroups.\",\n                \"In Hawaii, disaggregation of COVID-19 surveillance data facilitated collaboration between HDOH and community partners equipped with culturally situated knowledge (8, 10) to address disparities through tailored strategies.

This category was calculated by identifying the proportion of population, cases, and deaths that remained from the total Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population after considering Native Hawaiian single race data.  Pacific Islander subcategories represent the populations among this group with the largest representation in Hawaii. Persons of more than one specific Pacific Islander race could be in more than one specific Pacific Islander race category.

The term long COVID is used to describe post-acute sequelae and long-term symptoms that can be experienced from weeks to months by persons recovering from COVID-19. What is added by this report? In a random sample of recovered COVID-19 patients in Long Beach, California, one third of participants reported post-acute sequelae 2 months after their positive test result, with higher rates reported among persons aged 40 years, females, persons with preexisting conditions, and Black persons. What are the implications for public health practice? Identification of populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and long COVID can help guide efforts to prioritize prevention and treatment. and the symptom assessment period (from 14 days before to 10 days after\",\n                \"Discussion In this random sample of adults with a recent history of confirmed COVID-19, one third of participants reported post-acute sequelae 2 months after their SARS-CoV-2 positive test result, with higher odds among persons aged 4054 years, females, and those with preexisting conditions. Persons aged 40 years, females, those with preexisting conditions, and Black persons also reported higher rates of post-acute sequelae. As the number of recovered COVID-19 patients increases, monitoring the prevalence of post-acute sequelae among larger cohorts in diverse populations is important because it can help develop efforts to prioritize prevention and treatment strategies for these populations. These results are consistent with other published studies regarding age and female sex (1, 79) . Further, the associa - tions between sequelae and preexisting conditions have also been reported by other investigators (3, 7, 8); however, few reports have assessed variations by race/ethnicity (10), which is important because of existing inequities that might lead to higher risk for SARS-CoV-2.\",\n                \"BMI was cal-culated from height and weight measurements  and categorized based on sex-specific CDC BMI-for-age percentiles.

On August 25, 2021, the authors informed MMWR that some analyses were inaccurate because vaccination records of persons with a birth date between two vaccination dates could be counted as two distinct persons with different ages. This resulted in an artificial inflation of the population of partially vaccinated persons, which in turn affected the number of unvaccinated persons because that number is estimated as the total population size minus the fully vaccinated and the partially vaccinated groups. Programming code was adjusted to address this issue as well as three uncommon issues that had a relatively minor impact on findings. First, unvaccinated persons who received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 who subsequently received a first vaccination dose were not always counted towards the tally of unvaccinated COVID-19 cases. Second, persons who received additional doses before such doses were authorized had their date of full vaccination assigned based on final dose date, rather than series completion date.

It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans, in whom it acts as a central nervous system depressant and can cause respiratory depression, slowed heart rate, and hypotension (2) . When used as a toxic adulterant in illicitly produced opioids such as fentanyl or heroin (3), xylazine might potentiate sedation and respiratory depression, increasing the risk for fatal overdose. In addition, because xylazine is not an opioid, it does not respond to opioid reversal agents such as naloxone; therefore, if illicit opioid products containing xylazine are used, naloxone might be less effective in fully reversing an overdose. Several states have reported increases in xylazine-involved overdose deaths; however, the\",\n                \"SUDORS cases in which xyla - zine is listed on the death certificate as a contributing cause of death by the medical examiner or coroner were defined as xylazine-involved. Thus, a xylazine-involved case would also be considered to be xylazine-positive by definition; however, a xylazine-positive case would not always mean that xylazine contributed to the death (i. e. , xylazine-involved) . Using data from 38 states and DC, CDC examined xylazine-positive and xylazine-involved overdose deaths that occurred during 2019. In addition, detailed narrative text for each case was reviewed for information about xylazine use or presence among drug products or paraphernalia found at the scene.\",\n                \"Among 45, 676 overdose deaths reported to SUDORS dur - ing JanuaryDecember 2019, xylazine-positive (826; 1. 8%), and xylazine-involved (531; 1. 2%) deaths were identified in 25 and 23 states, respectively. Xylazine was listed as a cause of death in 64. 3% of deaths in which it was detected. The majority of xylazine-involved deaths were among males (73. 1%), non-Hispanic White persons (75. 4%), and from states in the Northeast Census region (67. 0%) .

Several states have reported increases in xylazine-involved overdose deaths; however, the prevalence of xylazine involvement in drug overdose deaths (overdose deaths) has not been extensively studied, particularly in the United States (4). To better understand the impact of xylazine adulteration on the evolving drug overdose epidemic in the United States, CDC analyzed unintentional and undetermined intent overdose death data from the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) in 38 states and the District of Columbia (DC). *, A SUDORS case was defined as xylazine-positive if xylazine was detected on postmortem toxicology or if xylazine was listed on the death certificate as a contributing cause of death * SUDORS captures data on fatal unintentional and undetermined intent overdoses. For all captured overdose deaths, SUDORS records all drugs detected by postmortem toxicology, even those not ruled by a medical examiner or coroner to have contributed to the death. A drug was recorded as contributing to death when the death certificate or medical examiner or coroner report listed the drug as a contributing factor. Thirty-eight states and DC reported data during January 2019December 2019. Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported deaths that occurred during the entire period: Alaska, California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Recreational drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl are often adulterated with agents such as xylazine to enhance drug effects or increase street value by increasing net weight. Xylazine is known to cause hypotension and bradycardia when used in humans. Although not a controlled substance in the United States, xylazine cannot be purchased without a veterinary license. Misuse of xylazine was reported in Puerto Rico in the early 2000s. Recreational use of xylazine can occur via oral inges - tion, inhalation or sniffing, or intravenous injection; however, injection is the most common route of administration. The effects of xylazine when used contemporaneously with other illicit drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl are still not widely known. No antidote is recommended for the effects of xylazine overdose. One recent study suggests that high doses of naloxone might reverse the effects of a clonidine overdose. However, given that this finding is from a single study of a small cohort of pediatric patients, it might not be generalizable to the broader population. Furthermore, no reports specific to xylazine and naloxone exist regarding reversal of effects. \",\n                \"References 1. Busard FP, Pichini S, Pacifici R, Karch SB.

First, although limiting the analysis period to after universal adult vaccine eligibility and age stratification likely helped to reduce biases, residual differences between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated groups have the potential to reduce estimated VE. Second, the analysis excluded partially vaccinated persons, to robustly assess VE for fully vaccinated compared with that of unvaccinated persons. A supplementary sensitivity analysis that included partially vaccinated persons as unvaccinated yielded conservative VE for laboratory-confirmed infection (declining from 89. 0% to 71. 4%) and for hospitaliza - tions (ranging from 87. 7% to 93. 6%) .
