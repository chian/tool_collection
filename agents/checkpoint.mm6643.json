To monitor progress toward achieving IIS program goals, CDC surveys jurisdictions through an annual self-administered IIS Annual Report (IISAR). Data from the 2013-2016 IISARs were analyzed to assess progress made in four priority areas: 1) data completeness, 2) bidirectional exchange of data with electronic health record systems, 3) clinical decision support for immunizations, and 4) ability to generate childhood vaccination coverage estimates. IIS participation among children aged 4 months through 5 years increased from 90% in 2013 to 94% in 2016, and 33) jurisdictions reported (>=)95% of children aged 4 months through 5 years participating in their IIS in 2016.

For IISs to support real-time immunization efforts both at the population level and at the point of clinical care, these systems need to capture complete childhood immunization data. To promote IIS functionality\",\n                \"To support real-time immunization efforts both at the population level and at the point of clinical care, these systems need to capture complete childhood immunization data. To promote IIS functionality and data quality, CDC and external partners, including state/local immunization programs and IIS vendors, developed 27 Functional Standards to guide IIS development from 2013 to 2017 (_I_). CDC monitors progress toward these Functional Standards through a self-administered survey known as the IIS Annual Report (IISAR). During 2016-2017, CDC issued guidance to jurisdictions identifying four priority areas (covering multiple Functional Standards) that immunization programs should focus on before developing other IIS functionalities. The four priority areas are: 1) data completeness for children aged 0-6 years (Functional Standard 1.1, 3.1); 2) bidirectional information exchange with electronic health record systems (1.4, 1.5); 3) pediatric clinical decision support for immunizations (1.2), and 4) ability to generate jurisdictional and provider-level childhood vaccination coverage estimates (5.2). This report assesses progress toward achieving success in these four priority areas from 2013 to 2016, using data from the 2013-2016 IISARs. IISAR is a secure web-based survey instrument distributed annually to state, local, and territorial immunization programs by CDC. Immunization programs self-report their IIS's progress toward meeting the Functional Standards during the previous calendar year.\",\n                \"Data completeness comprises four measures: birth record capture, child participation, provider participation, and IIS coverage estimate comparison to NIS-Child.

Childhood IIS participation increased from 90% in 2013 to 94% in 2016, which approaches the Healthy People 2020 objective of (>=)95% child IIS participation. Among the 55 jurisdictions, 33 (60%) reported that (>=)95% of children aged 4 months through 5 years in their geographic area participated in their IIS in 2016, compared with 24 (44%) in 2013. In 2016, provider participation was 85% among VFC provider sites enrolled in an IIS. The number of VFC provider sites enrolled in an IIS decreased from 41,710 in 2014 to 41,393 in 2016. Among these enrolled sites, the number of VFC provider sites participating in an IIS increased slightly from 33,266 in 2013 to 34,662 in 2016 (Figure 1).\",\n                \"For the combined 7-vaccine series,** the number of jurisdictions with IIS estimates within 10 percentage points of the corresponding NIS-Child coverage estimates increased from 17 in 2013\",\n                \"IISs can be used to generate coverage estimates for childhood vaccinations at the jurisdictional level (e.g., state, postal code, or county) and at the provider level to identify vulnerable subpopulations.

This is 11% higher than in 2013, when 80% of jurisdictions provided these reports.

Notably, the increased number of jurisdictions that had IIS estimates that were within 10 percentage points of the corresponding NIS-Child coverage estimate suggests that more jurisdictions have IISs with more complete data, or at least that the IIS and NIS are similar in their ability to estimate vaccination coverage for that jurisdiction's population. jurisdictions with IIS coverage estimates that were at least 10 percentage points lower than the corresponding NIS-Child estimate might have less complete IIS data, particularly at sites with the largest IIS-NIS discrepancies.\",\n                \"For the combined 7-vaccine series, the number of jurisdictions with IIS estimates within 10 percentage points of the corresponding NIS-Child coverage estimates increased from 17 in 2013 to 25 in 2016 (Figure 2).

Using the combination of visualization and test strip approach allows for more immediate protective measures than laboratory confirmation of HABs, which might take several days to complete. Visual evidence in water bodies other than bathing beaches is also used as a trigger for LHDs to alert the public via social media, websites, press releases, and advisory signs.\",\n                \"During June-September 2015, NYSDOH received 51 HAB-associated illness reports from the pilot surveillance system, 35 (68.8%) of which met the CDC case definitions, including 32 in humans and three in dogs.

Additional surveillance activities were implemented by NYSDOH when an HAB was identified that posed a substantial public health concern affecting drinking water or recreational water activities. Such surveillance activities included 1) monitoring hospital syndromic surveillance data for patients who displayed symptoms consistent with HAB exposure, 2) providing educational materials to health care providers and veterinarians near the sites of HABs, and 3) coordinating with poison control centers to notify NYSDOH if suspected HAB exposure calls were received.\",\n                \"HAB-associated illnesses were voluntarily reported to NYSDOH through participating counties, NYSDEC, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and a veterinary office. Each report of illness was investigated using a questionnaire administered by either the LHD or NYSDOH and assessed using the CDC case definitions for HAB-associated illness. Case definitions are specific to animals and humans and take into consideration information such as environmental or visual evidence of an HAB, confirmation via toxin-detecting test strips, or laboratory confirmation (i.e., via microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, or density of blue green chlorophyll) along with clinical evidence of HAB exposure (e.g., consistency of symptoms and onset of illness after exposure).\",\n                \"During June-September 2015, NYSDOH received 51 HAB-associated illness reports from the pilot surveillance system, 35 (68.8%) of which met the CDC case definitions, including 32 in humans and three in\",\n                \"findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations.

Among the three wild poliovirus (WPV) serotypes, only type 1 (WPV1) has been detected since 2012. Since 2014, detection of WPV1 has been limited to three countries, with 37 cases in 2016 and 11 cases in 2017 as of September 27. The >99.999% decline worldwide in polio cases since\",\n                \"Classified definitively, were found among immunocompetent persons and environmental samples in 10 countries. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for new VDPV infections.\",\n                \"WPV type 2 (WPV2) was last detected in 1999 and global WPV2 eradication was declared in September 2015; WPV type 3 has not been detected since 2012. Since August 2014, residual endemic WPV1 transmission has been detected only in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria, mostly in inaccessible areas. In response to the emergence of multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated the synchronized withdrawal of the type 2 component (OPV2; Sabin type 2) from trivalent OPV (tOPV; Sabin types 1, 2, and 3) (_4_). In April 2016, all OPV-using countries switched to bivalent OPV (bOPV; Sabin types 1 and 3). Since the switch, the number of isolated Sabin 2 strains from both acute flacid paralysis and environmental surveillance systems has steadily declined (_5_). To monitor the disappearance of Sabin 2 strains and to ensure identification of type 2 VDPVs (VDPV2s), as of August 1, 2016, all poliovirus type 2 (PV2) isolates are referred for genetic sequencing.\",\n                \"Poliovirus isolates are grouped into three categories: WPV, vaccine-related poliovirus (VPRV), and VDPV. VRPVs have limited divergence in the capsid protein (VP1) nucleotide sequences from the corresponding OPV strain (polovirus type 1 and 3 [PV1 and PV3]; \\\\(\\\\leq\\\\)1% divergent; poliovirus type 2: \\\\(\\\\leq\\\\)0.6% divergent) (_3_). VDPVs are >1% divergent (for PV1 and PV3) or >0.6% divergent (for PV2) in VP1 nucleotide sequences from the corresponding OPV strain (_3_). VDPVs are further classified as 1) cVDPVs, when evidence of person-to-person transmission in the community exists; 2) iVDPVs, when they are isolated from persons with PIDs; and 3) aVDPVs, when they are clinical isolates from persons with no known\",\n                \"Evidence of person-to-person transmission in the community exists; 2) iVDPVs, when they are isolated from persons with PIDs; and 3) aVDPVs, when they are clinical isolates from persons with no known immunodeficiency and no evidence of transmission, or they are sewage isolates that are unrelated to other known VDPVs and whose source is unknown (_2_). GPEI guidelines about reporting and classification of VDPVs were last updated in August 2016.\",\n                \"All poliovirus isolates are characterized by laboratories of the Global Polio Laboratory Network. VDPV screening is conducted using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid amplification, targeted to nucleotide substitutions that frequently revert to the parental WPV sequence during replication of OPV in the human intestine (_6_). Starting August 1, 2016, the use of the VDPV2 screening assay was discontinued and all PV2 isolates are sequenced. Potential VDPVs identified by real-time RT-PCR screening are sequenced in the VP1 region for definitive analysis.\",\n                \"During January 2016-June 2017, the number of countries with detected cVDPV circulation decreased from seven to five since the previous reporting period (3) (Figure 1); all except one (cVDPV1 in Laos) reported cVDPV2 circulation (Table). No additional cases have been identified from previously reported VDPV outbreaks in Guinea (cVDPV2), Madagascar (cVDPV1), Myanmar (cVDPV2), Ukraine (cVDPV1), Pakistan (cVDPV2) and Nigeria (cVDPV2). Cases continued to be identified from the previously reported distinct cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria (7) and the previously reported cVDPV1 outbreak in Laos (3). New outbreaks were reported in DRC (two cVDPV2 emergences; one with six cases and one with two cases), Nigeria (cVDPV2, one case), Pakistan (cVDPV2, one case), and Syria (cVDPV2, 35 cases) (Table).

VDPVs can also emerge among persons with primary immunodeficiency (PIDs). Immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can replicate for years in some persons with PIDs. In addition, circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) can emerge very rarely among immunologically normal vaccine recipients and their contacts in areas with inadequate OPV coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio. This report updates previous summaries regarding VDPVs (_3_).\",\n                \"During January 2016-June 2017, new cVDPV outbreaks were identified, including two in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (eight cases), and another in Syria (35 cases), whereas the circulation of cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria resulted in cVDPV2 detection linked to a previous emergence. The last confirmed case from the 2015-2016 cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak in Laos occurred in January 2016. Fourteen newly identified persons in 10 countries were found to excrete iVDPVs, and three previously reported patients in the United Kingdom and Iran (_3_) were still excreting type 2 iVDPV (iVDPV2) during the reporting period.

Reported OPV coverage was low (74%); two monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) mass vaccination campaigns were conducted during July 13-29, 2017 and mop-up vaccination campaigns were conducted during September 17-20, 2017.\",\n                \"**Nigeria.** During the reporting period, cVDPV2s (with 3.5%-4.1% VP1 nucleotide divergence from a cVDPV2 emergence originating in Chad in 2012) were found only in the northern state of Borno.

During the reporting period, VDPV2s were detected both before and after the global withdrawal of OPV2 in April 2016. During the preswitch period [January 2016-April 2016], emergence of cVDPV2 in countries with low routine vaccination coverage underscored the risks of widening immunization gaps to PV2; detection of highly divergent cVDPV2s from sewage samples collected in the state capital adjacent to inaccessible areas of northeast Nigeria also indicated virus circulation that was missed by AFP surveillance. cVDPV2 outbreaks detected after the switch in both Syria and DRC highlighted the risks associated with chronically low tOPV vaccination coverage before the switch. Outbreak response to VDPV2 transmission after OPV2 cessation requires use of mOPV2; the scope and intensity of mOPV2 vaccination campaigns in outbreak areas is assessed by the mOPV2 Advisory Group, which advises the WHO Director General on release of mOPV2. Response to the cVDPV2 outbreak in Syria included two mOPV2 mass vaccination campaigns targeting >300,000 children aged <5 years, followed by inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) vaccination campaigns targeting >100,000 children aged 2-24 months, including populations at high risk in adjacent areas and countries.\",\n                \"sites has enhanced PV detection (_9_).

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50-100 times more potent than morphine, is primarily responsible for this rapid increase (3,4). In addition, fentanyl analogs such as acetylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, and carfentanil are being detected increasingly in overdose deaths (5,6) and the illicit opioid drug supply (7). Carfentanil is estimated to be 10,000 times more potent than morphine (8). Estimates of the potency of acetylfentanyl and furanylfentanyl vary but suggest that they are less potent than fentanyl (9). Estimates of relative potency have some uncertainty because illicit fentanyl analog potency has not been evaluated in humans.

Fentanyl was detected in at least half of opioid overdose deaths in seven of 10 states, and 57% of fentanyl-involved deaths also tested positive for other illicit drugs, such as heroin. Fentanyl analogs were present in >10% of opioid overdose deaths in four states, with carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl identified most frequently.
