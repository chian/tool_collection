According to the 2020 Surgeon General s report, smoking cessation may reduce CM but supporting evidence is not wide. Use of deep learning-based modeling that enables universal natural language processing of medical narratives to acquire population-based real-life smoking data may help overcome the challenge. Weassessed the effect of smoking status and within-1-year smoking cessation on CM by an in-house adapted freelyavailable language processing algorithm. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional real-world study included 29 823 patients diagnosed with cancer in 20092018 in Southwest Finland. The medical narrative, International Classi cation of Diseases-10th edition codes, histology, cancer treatment records, and death certi cates were combined. Over 162 000 sentences describing tobacco smoking behavior were analyzed with ULMFiT and BERT algorithms. Results: The language model classi ed the smoking status of 23 031 patients. Recent quitters had reduced CM [hazard ratio (HR) 0. 80 (0. 74-0. 87) ] and OM [HR 0. 78 (0. 72-0. 84) ] compared to persistent smokers. Compared to never smokers, persistent smokers had increased CM in head and neck, gastro-esophageal, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and breast cancerand Hodgkin s lymphoma, irrespective of age, comorbidities, performance status, or presence of metastatic disease. Increased CM was also observed in smokers with colorectal cancer, men with melanoma or bladder cancer, andlymphoid and myeloid leukemia, but no longer independently of the abovementioned covariates. Speci city and sensitivity were 96%/96%, 98%/68%, and 88%/99% for never, former, and current smokers, respectively, beingessentially the same with both models. Conclusions: Deep learning can be used to classify large amounts of smoking data from the medical narrative with good accuracy. The results highlight the detrimental effects of persistent smoking in oncologic patients and emphasize thatsmoking cessation should always be an essential element of patient counseling. Key words: deep learning, arti cial intelligence, tobacco use, cancer survival INTRODUCTION While smoking is a well-established risk factor for the development of many types of cancer, the 2020 report from the Surgeon General of the US Department of Health andHuman Services emphasizes the need to assess the healtheffects of smoking cessation. 1It has been estimated that two-thirds of patients who smoke continue to do so aftercancer diagnosis. 2, 3This is alarming, since there is accumulating evidence that persistent smoking after cancerdiagnosis impairs cancer-speci c survival in multiple cancer types, 4including small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancer (SCLC and NSCLC, respectively), 5, 6prostate, 7, 8head and neck, 9, 10colorectal, 11, 12and bladder cancer. 13In breast cancer, con icting results are reported, but large metaanalyses have demonstrated that persistent smoking is associated with poorer breast cancer-speci c survival, especially in heavy smokers. 14, 15 Deep learning is an advanced subtype of arti cial intelligence-based machine learning, which is making its wayinto clinical medicine via various diagnostic and predictiveapplications. 16, 17This includes universal language modeling of medical narratives, wherein real-life practice health data, such*Correspondence to: Dr Eetu Heerv, Department of Oncology, Turku University Hospital, Hmeentie 11, Turku 20521, Finland.

We applied this experimental setting on cancer patients diag-nosed in the Turku University Hospital region, and subse-quently analyzed (i) the effect of the individual s smoking status and (ii) the effect of recent smoking cessation onsurvival after cancer diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethics The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland (T132/2019) . Noinformed consent was required according to the Finnish Acton Secondary Use of Health and Social Data. Based on theact, EHRs were reviewed and data were stored in a securedanalysis environment protected by the hospital rewall. Study population Turku University Hospital is a tertiary referral Organization of European Cancer Institutes-designated cancer centercovering the entire region with 480 000 inhabitants. The neighboring regions of Satakunta and Vaasa, with populations of 220 000 and 66 000, respectively, may referpatients to Turku for cancer care. Since 2004, Turku Uni-versity Hospital uses a real-time updated EHR system. TheEHRs were searched for all patients with at least one In-ternational Classi cation of Diseases-10th edition (ICD-10) C code, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (C44) . Allpatients whose rst ICD-10 C code was recorded during 2009-2018 were included in the current study (Figure 1) . Denition of source data The unique Finnish personal identi cation number was used to link patient-level data from different information sys-tems, including ICD-10 codes, histology [International Clas-sication of Diseases for Oncology-third edition (ICD-O-3) codes], Nordic operational codes [Nordic Medico-StatisticalCommittee (NOMESCO) ], and chemotherapy [AnatomicalTherapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classi cation codes] and radiotherapy records, to the medical narrative. For each patient, their medical narrative from 2004 to 2019 includingon average 5600 words was extracted for languagemodeling. An extensive cross-linking of structured data wascarried out to cross-validate all cancer diagnoses as accu-rately as possible. In case of discrepancy, such as a patientpresenting with multiple ICD-10 codes, histology was usedto establish the dominant diagnosis. Date and cause of death were veri ed from Statistics Finland, an independent national registry. This veri cation also excluded non-Finnish citizens and ascertained complete follow-up. The number of incident cancer cases per regionwas obtained from the online statistics of the Cancer Reg-istry of Finland (https: //cancerregistry. /statistics/cancerstatistics/) to assess the population coverage. EHRs were searched for body mass index (BMI), presence of select comorbidities, and Eastern Cooperative OncologyGroup (ECOG) performance status. We de ned synchronously metastatic cancer as presence of a metastasis code (C77-79) within 6 months of primary tumor diagnosis. Language modeling for smoking status For the current study, we built and used two language models, ULMFiT and Google BERT, 23, 24both of which use transfer learning. Firstly, a large amount of unlabeled data isleveraged to pre-train a model that performs well in the task of guessing masked words in phrases from the training data. The model learns a useful mathematical representa-tion for the words and their connections. In this pre-trainingphase, the learned knowledge is transferred to a classi er supplemented with smaller amounts of manually labeledtraining data. The strength of this approach is that thesemodels can be pre-trained with freely available Finnish text, and then manually ne-tuned with smaller clinical datasets, which in medicine are often hard and expensive to obtain. Since no pre-trained models for Finnish were publicly available when we initiated the study, we pre-trained theULMFiT model with the entire Finnish Wikipedia 2019 usingthe computer infrastructure at our hospital. For BERT, a pre-trained model for Finnish was later available. 24The learned knowledge was then transferred to a training classi er, by randomly picking 5000 tobacco smoking-related sample phrases and sentences from the medical narrative archive of our hospital, using the Finnish word-stem tupak equivalent to the English word-stem smok. 19These sample phrases were manually labeled into three classes (never, former, orcurrent smoker) . ULMFiTand BERT-based classi cation models were then trained on this data to produce smokingphrase classi ers. To de ne an individual s tobacco smoking status, a logic was added to both models when multiple classi cations were present over time. Individuals labeled as both neverand former smokers were classi ed as former smokers. In any other case, the average probability for each class overthe patient s sentences was calculated for each smoking status classi cation, and the highest probability was used to determine the nal status. After language model classi cation, recent quitters were identi ed by extracting cessation year, where available, for ULMFiT-de ned former smokers. Recent quitters were those who quit within 1 year before or any time aftercancer diagnosis. 1 Statistical analysis The primary outcome measure was CM, de ned as death due to any cancer. The secondary endpoint was overall mortalityESMO Open A. Karlsson et al. 2 https: //doi. org/10. 1016/j. esmoop. 2021. 100175 Volume 6 -Issue 3 -2021 (OM), de ned as death due to any cause. All patients were censored at the time of death or at the end of follow-up inDecember 2019. Firstly, hazard ratios (HRs) were calculatedwith the Cox proportional hazards model with 95% con dence interval (CI 95), using sex as the categorical covariate with the enter method to control confounding. In case of signi cant sex interaction (P<0. 05), men and women were subsequently analyzed separately. Secondly, multivariate Cox regression was carried out, adjusting HRs for age >70 years, presence of synchronous metastasis (solid tumors only), ECOG 2 or more, presence of select comorbidities (Supplementary Table S1, available at https: //doi. org/10. 1016/j. esmoop. 2021. 100175), and BMI <20 kg/m 2. SPSS version 26 (IBM, Armonk, NY) was used. Sensitivity and speci city analyses were calculated with 2/C22 contingency tables separately for never, former, and persistent smokers, excluding patients with missing smoking status, 19using the Python sklearn package. RESULTS The cohort consisted of 29 823 patients (14 717 females) with 35 394 cancers and a median (interquartile) age of 67 (58-76) years (Supplementary Table S1, available at https: //doi. org/10. 1016/j. esmoop. 2021. 100175) . Median overall survival was not reached in female and 88. 8 months in male cancer patients, with 5-year survival rates of 65% and 57%, respectively. At theend of follow-up, 12 244 patients had died with a minimum of 1year of follow-up. Median follow-up was 5. 2 years both in theentire series and in those alive at the end of the study. Goodpopulation coverage was observed as compared to nationaldata from the Cancer Registry of Finland, being lowest in lung (81%), renal (92%), and colorectal cancer (93%, Supplementary Table S2, available at https: //doi. org/10. 1016/j. esmoop. 2021. 100175) . When medical narratives were analyzed, we found on average 7 hits (range 0-116) per patient for sentences thatdescribe patient s smoking behavior. The ULMFiT language model classi ed a total of 11 338 never, 5789 former, and 5904 persistent smokers. For 6792 patients, especially in ovarian andendometrial cancers, we found no mention of smoking (Supplementary Table S3, available at https: //doi. org/10. 1016/ j. esmoop. 2021. 100175) .

Speci city and sensitivity with the ULMFiT model were 96%/96%, 98%/68%, and88%/99% for never, former, and current smokers, respec-tively. With the BERT model, the respective speci city and sensitivity were 96%/96%, 96%/73%, and 90%/97%. Thediscrepant cases were elderly people who had tried smok-ing in their youth, smokers attempting to quit, or thosewhere only the most recent EHR entry suggested successful smoking cessation. Smoking impairs cancer and overall mortality In male patients with cancer, as compared to never smokers, both persistent [HR 1. 54 (1. 49-1. 60) ] and formersmoking [HR 1. 58 (1. 46-1. 71) ] increased CM (Figure 2) . Similar results, but smaller in size, were observed in female Figure 2. KaplaneMeier graphs of 5-year cancer (A and B) and overall mortality (C and D) according to sex.

Results with OM appeared similar but were of lesser magnitude (Figure 2) . Speci cally, persistent smokers had increased CM in head and neck cancer, gastro-esophageal cancer, colorectal can-cer, NSCLC, SCLC, cutaneous melanoma (men only), prostatecancer, bladder cancer (men only), Hodgkin s lymphoma, and both lymphoid and myeloid leukemia (Figure 3) . In former smokers, a trend favoring higher CM was observedin the abovementioned cancers, being signi cant in NSCLC, SCLC, bladder and prostate cancer, and lymphoid leukemia (Supplementary Figure S1, available at https: //doi. org/10. 1016/j. esmoop. 2021. 100175) . Never smokers werepredominantly female, and smokers were on average 3 years younger and had more often poor performance statusas compared to others (Supplementary Table S1, available athttps: //doi. org/10. 1016/j. esmoop. 2021. 100175) . HRs of OM rarely exceeded HRs of CM, with the exceptions of myeloma, females with bladder cancer, and formersmokers with cutaneous melanoma and renal cancer (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S1, available at https: //doi. org/10. 1016/j. esmoop. 2021. 100175) .

Thus, smoking emerged as a signi cant covariate in pancreatic and breast cancer, while signi cance was no longer observed in cutaneous melanoma and colorectal cancer (Table 1) . Recent quitting reduces cancer mortality Smoking cessation year could be extracted for 2803 (48%) former smokers. An additional 41 recent quitters were identi ed during the manual validation process; thus, a total of 524 patients met the criteria for recent quitter. 1 Compared to those who continue smoking, recent quittingreduced both CM [HR 0. 80 (0. 74-0. 87), Table 2 ] and OM [HR 0. 78 (0. 72-0. 84), Table 2 ]. A tendency for lower CM and OM was observed almost in every cancer type except forbladder cancer, where only reduced OM after smokingcessation was observed. Interestingly, also in the sub-group of 2282 patients with synchronous metastatic disease, reduced OM was observed in 53 recent quitters ascompared to 759 persistent smokers with a HR of 0. 85 (0. 72-0. 98) . DISCUSSION The recent Surgeon General s report emphasized the need to assess the health effects of smoking cessation at the timeof cancer diagnosis. 1Motivated by this report, we applied deep learning-based language modeling to analyze the medical narratives of a large cross-sectional cohort of can-cer patients. With good population-based coverage, weconrmed the detrimental effect of persistent smoking on CM and OM in many types of cancer (head and neck, colorectal, NSCLC, SCLC, melanoma, breast, prostate, bladder, and myeloid leukemia) .

Furthermore, a major nding was that patients who quit smoking not earlier than 1 year before diagnosisshowed signi cantly improved cancer and overall survival, including those with synchronously metastatic disease. One major strength of the current study is that we were able to link extensive structured clinical data to smokingdata, and showed that smoking was an independentmodi able risk factor for CM in multiple cancer types. While the detrimental effects of persistent smoking have been shown before, 4, 21our results suggest that smoking cessation is bene cial irrespective of patient s age, comorbidities, or metastatic disease. We also analyzed OM along with CMand observed that OM HRs rarely exceeded CM HRs, sug-gesting that cancer patients who continue smoking willprobably die due to cancer and not from other tobacco-related diseases. Articial intelligence and deep learning applications are making their way into clinical practice, but their ef cacy is not yet proven in prospective trial settings. 16The current study utilized more advanced deep learning compared toprevious reports 18-20in a retrospective proof-of-principle setting, where we successfully extracted a large amountof smoking data in a matter of days. Two language modelswere tested with good speci city (88%-98%), comparable to the previous results in English language. 19The BERT model included a pre-trained model for Finnish, 24but with seemingly only slightly improved speci city in persistent smokers compared to ULMFiT. Discrepancies were mostcommonly due to unsuccessful attempts to quit, and theindividual s smoking status was ultimately based on probability logic instead of on the language model itself. Mis-classi cations also had human reasons behind them; elderly people who tried smoking in their youth are former smokers by De nition, while human classi cation may overlook sporadic smoking. Furthermore, the amount ofmissing data was almost always true missing data, whichmay re ect healthcare professionals current practices and attitudes toward reporting smoking behavior of theirpatients. 25 In the current study, 524 (8%) smokers at the time of cancer diagnosis managed to quit smoking and remain abstinent. This 8% is probably an underestimate, since thecessation year was found only in 48% of former smokers, but may re ect the hardships of smoking cessation in a realworld population. For comparison, abstinence rates of 36%-43% have been reported in large surveys and smokingcessation programs. 2, 3, 22Regardless of missing cessation years, our study showed a reduced CM and OM in recent quitters compared to persistent smokers. We observed that former smokers were more often ECOG 0-1 compared tosmokers, without explanatory sex or age differences. One novel observation in our study is that smoking was an independent risk factor for Hodgkin s lymphoma mortality. However, the current study was not speci cally designed to address predictive factors in lymphomas, andsurvival may be affected by a variety of unavailablecovariates, including staging of hematological malignancies. The same holds also true for lymphoid leukemia, while in myeloid leukemia the detrimental effect of smoking has been reported earlier. 26While smoking is a well-known adverse factor in esophageal cancer, 1in pancreatic and gastric cancer smoking data are scarce or derived fromAsian populations. 27, 28Results on cutaneous melanoma should be observed with caution, since detrimental effectsof smoking were observed in men only and not signi cant once adjusted for other covariates, but are in line with previous reports. 4, 21 The limitations of our study include its retrospective single-center nature and that we used only Finnish texts. However, ULMFiT and BERT are designed as universal lan-guage models, and the same methodology can be applied inany language provided enough data are available. 19, 23, 24We acknowledge that our results should be reproduced indifferent languages before wider implementation. A possible limitation of our study design is that language models such as ours are trained on ordinary, everydaylanguage from Wikipedia pages and discussion forums. Medical text is typically laden with technical terms that donot appear in everyday discussions, which could inhibit thetransferability of what the model has learned in the pre-training phase. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the largest comprehensive deep learning-based registry of smoking behaviors in cancer patients. We applied this experimental setting to link theindividual s smoking status to cancer outcome and demonstrated the detrimental effects of persistent smokingon CM across multiple types of cancer independent of age, presence of metastatic disease, BMI, performance status, orcomorbidities. The current study suggests that cancer sur-vival may be improved through smoking cessation, and it is never too late to quit. These results encourage a broader international validation of language models in clinicalpractice and emphasize that smoking counseling shouldalways be an integral part of cancer care.
